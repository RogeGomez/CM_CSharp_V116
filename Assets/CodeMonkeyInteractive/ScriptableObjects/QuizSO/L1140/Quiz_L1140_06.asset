  question: If you want to pass data to a function, how should you do it?
  optionList:
  - Through function parameters.
  - By defining a global variable.
  - By writing the data directly into the function code.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'The function should define parameters for whatever data it needs to complete
    the logic within the function, that data is usually received as a parameter.

    Technically
    you could also use global variables like class variabels, however in order to
    minimize complexity within your code you should avoid this if you can and make
    sure the function receives all the data it needs to do its work.
