  title: What are access modifiers in C#, and why are they important?
  text: 'This is what defines how accessible a certain field/function can be. It
    defines whether a different class can access that field or not.

    Access modifiers
    are extremely important because they help you limit access and you should limit
    access as much as possible since that is one of the best ways to manage complexity.

    I
    talk about this topic in more detail in the Clean Code Guidelines lecture in
    a bit.
