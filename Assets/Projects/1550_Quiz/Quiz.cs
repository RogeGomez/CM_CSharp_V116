         * Ask player the question, player answers
         * Check if answer is correct
         * Keep asking questions until there`s no more
         * 
         * Hint: You can store multiple pieces of data in one variable using collections
         * For example a List<string> or a string[] array
         * Then you can cycle through it with: for (int i = 0; i < list.Count; i++) {   }
